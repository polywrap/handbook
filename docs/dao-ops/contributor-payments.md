title: Core Contributor Payments Guide
---

We believe payment experiences should be simple for our contributors. If you need help during any part of the process, message one of our DAO members in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Z5m88a5qWu).

## **Overview**

Contributor payments are made in a combination of Stable Coin (`USDC`, `USDT`, or `DAI`) and our DAO's `WRAP-IOU` token.

Payment is based on the hourly rate that you pick on your grant proposal.

The below table is simply a guideline to help you set your **hourly rate**.

| Level        | Years of Experience | Option 1         | Option 2         | Option 3         | Option 4        |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Junior       | 0-2                 | 0.10 `WRAP`, $50 | 0.25 `WRAP`, $35 | 0.45 `WRAP`, $20 | 0.75 `WRAP`, $0 |
| Intermediate | 2-4                 | 0.12 `WRAP`, $65 | 0.30 `WRAP`, $50 | 0.54 `WRAP`, $35 | 0.90 `WRAP`, $0 |
| Senior       | 4+                  | 0.14 `WRAP`, $80 | 0.35 `WRAP`, $65 | 0.63 `WRAP`, $50 | 1.05 `WRAP`, $0 |

In order for you to get paid timely for your work, follow the steps below:

### **1. Get accepted into the DAO as a core contributor**

To get accepted into the DAO as a core contributor, you must successfully pass the job interview for the role you selected. Your interviewer will then put up a Snapshot proposal to vote you in as a core contributor. If the proposal passes, you can then submit your grant proposal, which includes your contributor log.

### **2. Creating a grant proposal and updating your contributor log**

You'll get paid through Polywrap DAO Grants and you need to keep contributor logs for your work done.

Throughout the month, you can update your contributor log in the [Logs category](https://forum.polywrap.io/c/contributors/logs/44).

> To make sure that our team can pay you on time, please finalize your logs by the **end of the first week of each month**!

### 3. Getting paid!

Each month, a DAO operations team member will post up the finalized contributor logs for voting. If the Snapshot passes, the DAO can then process payment for the contributors.
