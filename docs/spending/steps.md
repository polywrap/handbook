title: Spending Step-by-Step

## Context

Polywrap Spending Proposals are required whenever the DAO spends from the Gnosis Safe treasury. The Gnosis Safe page can be found [here](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x8c3FA50473065f1D90f186cA8ba1Aa76Aee409Bb/balances).

## Objectives

- Transparent way to show the community what the DAO plans to spend on
- Allows DAO members to vote on accepting or rejecting the spending the proposal

## Workflow

**1. Informal Discussion**

The workflow would depend on the type of spending but typically, it would begin with a discussion on Discord about whether the payment is needed. Some proposals, like contributor payments, are recurring and so regular discussions aren't required.

**2. Create a Spending Proposal**

Once the contributor feels ready to submit their spending proposal, they would post the proposal to the payment logs forum post as well as a Snapshot proposal to be voted on. The links to these can be found below:

- [Contributor & General Payment Logs](https://forum.polywrap.io/t/contributor-general-payment-logs/84/20)
- [Snapshot Proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/polywrap.eth)

**3. Snapshot Proposal**
Both the Snapshot proposal and the payment log would follow the [spending proposal template](/spending/spending-template).

The Snapshot proposal will have an "Accept" and "Reject" option for DAO community voting, and will be live for at 24-48 hours from posting.

Spending proposals are less stringent than Polywrap Improvement Proposals (PIPs) and only require at least 2 tokenholders to vote.

**4. Payment Processing**
Once a spending proposal has passed, the contributor would notify the Gnosis Safe signers who would then process the payment.

The forum post is updated with a link to the Snapshot proposal, and any support for the outgoing payment such as nonce number or transaction hash.
