title: Project Proposals Step-by-Step
---

## Context

If you're a `WRAP-IOU` token holder, this guide will show you how you can submit a proposal to work on the project for the DAO. Use the [proposal template](./proposal-template.md) when proposing a project to the DAO. Any questions can be directed to **@keeevin#7783** on the Discord server.

## Workflow

**1. Create a proposal in the spending forum**

The author would create a proposal in the [spending category](https://forum.polywrap.io/c/spending/39).

The format for the subject line should be `[Author] Project Proposal - Name of Proposal`.

**2. Discussion**
The author would then notify DAO members to discuss the proposal by messaging the `#governance` channel in the Polywrap DAO discord server.

Proposals should be up for a minimum of 3 days.

**3. Snapshot**
After the merits of the proposal are discussed, the author can make the changes suggested by the other DAO members before posting on Snapshot for DAO voting.

- The proposal has a voting period of at least 3 days where token holders may vote ACCEPT or REJECT.
- For a proposal to pass:
  - 5% of the circulating `WRAP-IOU` tokens must participate
  - 50% or more must vote FOR
  - At least 4 tokenholders must vote

**4. Implementation**
Approved proposals will be executed via multisig where necessary. Otherwise, implementation of each proposal will vary on a case-by-case basis.
