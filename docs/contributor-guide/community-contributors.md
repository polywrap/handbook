## Overview

We welcome and greatly appreciate anyone joining our community to contribute to the DAO! As a community contributor, you have many opportunities to make a big impact on the project. This guide will provide details with the following:

- [Introducing Yourself to the Community](#introducing-yourself-to-the-community)
- [The Community Bounty Board](#)
- [Creating Your Own Proposals](#)
- [Community Hackathons](#)

> Note:
> Community contributors work on **short-term** one-off projects for the Polywrap DAO. If you're looking for longer term projects, consider joining our team as a [core contributor](/contributor-guide/core-contributors).

## Introducing Yourself to the Community

When you join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bGsqQrNhqd), give a quick intro in the `#intros` channel.

## The Community Bounty Board

The first place to check for opportunities to contribute and be rewarded is the [Community Bounty Board](https://forum.polywrap.io/c/bounty-board/55).
