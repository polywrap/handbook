## Overview

We welcome and greatly appreciate anyone joining our community to contribute to the DAO! As a community contributor, you have many opportunities to make a big impact on the project. This guide provides details on the following:

- [Introducing Yourself to the Community](#introducing-yourself-to-the-community)
- [The Community Bounty Board](#the-community-bounty-board)
- [Community Hackathons](#community-hackathons)

## Introducing Yourself to the Community

When you join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bGsqQrNhqd), give a quick intro in the `#intros` channel.

## The Community Bounty Board

The first place to check for opportunities to contribute and be rewarded is the [Community Bounty Board](https://app.dework.xyz/polywrap-dao/community-board?inviteId=b7dc4cea-6687-4dc6-a626-a239).

## Community Hackathons

The community hackathons are a way for you to earn rewards and learn more about the project. Our hackathons aren't limited to just developers â€” in the past, we've had technical submissions like dApps and wrappers as well as non-technical ones like articles, memes, and more. In short, the only requirement is that your hackathon provides some kind of benefit to the Polywrap ecosystem.

Our hackathons are ongoing. To get started, simply join our Discord and visit the `#mini-hacks` channel to let us know what you're working on. Our team is happy to give feedback and support on your project when we can.
