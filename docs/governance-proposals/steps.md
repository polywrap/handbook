title: Governance Proposals Step-by-Step
---

## Context

Polywrap governance proposals that steer the direction of the Polywrap DAO operation decisions, strategy, development and more. This document provides a streamlined approach to contributions.

## Workflow

**1. Create a proposal in the governance forum**

The author would create a proposal on the governance forum.

**2. Discussion**
The author would then notify DAO members to discuss the proposal by messaging the `#governance` channel in the Polywrap DAO discord server.

**3. Snapshot**
After the merits of the proposal are discussed, the author can make the changes suggested by the other DAO members before posting on Snapshot for DAO voting.

- The proposal has a voting period of at least 2 days where token holders may vote FOR or AGAINST.
- For a governance proposal to pass
  - 5% of the circulating `WRAP-IOU` tokens must participate
  - 50% or more must vote FOR
  - At least 4 tokenholders must vote

**4. Post Voting Process**
After the snapshot voting period has concluded, the author will tally votes and update the Polywrap Community Documentation record with the related voting data. If a proposal has passed, the governance proposal is moved from proposed to approved. If a proposal is rejected the proposal may be moved to rejected or back to WIP to be revised for future consideration.

**5. Implementation**
Approved governance proposals will be executed via multisig where necessary. Otherwise, implementation of each governance proposal will vary on a case-by-case basis.
