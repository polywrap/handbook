## Our Values

### Social Values

**Collaboration**  
We encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing among DAO members.

**Transparency**  
We believe in transparent communication and the willingness to listen to others in the community, even when the conversation is difficult.

**Ownership**  
We design pathways to protocol ownership for all contributors.

### Technical Values

**Thoughtful Balance**  
We hold the technical principles of Security, Efficiency, Modularity, and Portability as key concerns to balance in our designs and their implementations.

**Code Styling**  
We believe code styling is just as important as its functionality. Our code should have high readability and be self-documenting.

### Process Values

**Lightweight Processes**  
We will only introduce processes as-needed and will thoughtfully weigh the trade-offs of each one.

**Sustainable Velocity**  
We have a timeline for project milestones that give us time for stable, quality releases but also keeps us accountable for keeping up a healthy velocity.
