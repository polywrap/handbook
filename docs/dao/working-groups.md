[List of current core contributors](/dao/core-team)

### Toolchain

This WG works on the core toolchain. The code is found in our [monorepo](https://github.com/polywrap/monorepo).

Projects in this WG include:

- The Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Package maintenance
- Version registry
- Demos

### Applications

The Applications WG works on end-user products. Today, we have two applications: the Polywrap Hub and Polyfolio.

The Hub is an application in which users could view deployed wrappers. Users could test wrappers directly in the app using a "Postman-like" interface to query endpoints. The Hub also lets users deploy their own wrappers to decentralized storage like IPFS.

Polyfolio is a DeFi information aggregator. It lets users connect their wallets and see their DeFi positions on protocols like Uniswap and Aave. It's built using a wrapper called defi-sdk.
