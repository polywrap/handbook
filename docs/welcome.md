## Contributing to the Polywrap DAO

We're always looking for community members to bring their talent and creativity to build the future of Web 3.

There are two types of contributors: Community and Core.

### Community Contributors

These are members of the community who are interesting in contributing to the DAO on a short-term project. The projects can be ones that are defined by the Polywrap team or one that you're interested in proposing to the DAO.

For more information on contributing as a **Community Contributor**, visit our [Community Contribution guide](/contributor-guide/community-contributor).

### Core Contributors

These are contributors who are part of the core team. They work on long-term projects that have detailed roadmap and milestones.

Visit our [Core Contributor guide](/contributor-guide/core-contributors) to get started.
