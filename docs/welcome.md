The Polywrap DAO community handbook is the central repository for how we run our DAO. It's completely open source and we welcome any feedback. Please make a merge request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions.

## What is Polywrap?

The Polywrap DAO was formed to stewart the development of the Polywrap toolchain. Our set of developer tools enables web 3.0 developers to more easily build decentralized applications (dApps). For a deep dive into Polywrap, visit our [developer documentation](#).

Here is a talk at EthCC giving an overview of our technology:
