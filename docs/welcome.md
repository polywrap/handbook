Welcome to our community handbook! This handbook will help you learn more about our project and show you how you can get involved in our DAO.

## What's Polywrap?

Polywrap is a set of developer tools that significantly improves the development experience of those building on web3. For a deep dive into our technology, visit our [developer documentation](https://docs.polywrap.io/).

## Contributing to the Polywrap DAO

We're always looking for community members to bring their talent and creativity to build the future of web3.

There are two types of contributors: Community and Core.

### Community Contributors

These are members of the community who are interesting in contributing to the DAO on a short-term project. The projects can be ones that are defined by the Polywrap team or one that you're interested in proposing to the DAO.

For more information on contributing as a **Community Contributor**, visit our [Community Contribution guide](/contributor-guide/community-contributors).

### Core Contributors

These are contributors who are part of the core team. They work on long-term projects that have detailed roadmap and milestones.

Visit our [Core Contributor guide](/contributor-guide/core-contributors) to get started. -->
